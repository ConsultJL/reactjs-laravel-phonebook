# ReactJS Laravel Phonebook
A really really simple ReactJS Laravel backed Phonebook

* Make sure you create a database in MySQL

* Update your .env details

* Run 
```
php artisan migrate
```

With the above done you're off to the races. There are limited test included in the test directory which can be run via phpunit. 

## Extending
I'm probably going to keep extending this to further work with ReactJS. A few things I'd like to do are
* Add auth so each user has a different phonebook
* Add an admin to control different users
* Extend the functionality to include notes, different addresses, contact numbers etc
* Add a search functionality to look up users
* Anything else I can think of!
